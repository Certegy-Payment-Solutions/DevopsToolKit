Url is the path to your board, make sure to keep the `{}` so Upsource can perform the necessary regex.

If your JIRA board is not on the Sourcetoad board. Please retrieve the url and an appropriate username/password for this to work. This user will have to have the necessary permission to manage the project in question.
